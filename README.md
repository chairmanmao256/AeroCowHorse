## What is Cowhorse?
Genearally speaking, being a cowhorse means that you do a lot of work for your boss, and you are paid with nothing but more work.

## Summarize working hour for your BOSS

AeroCowHorse is a piece of Python code used together with the DeLi Sign-in machine. It is used to read the working hour table generated by the machine. Use this code to work for your boss, tell him/her who works for the longest hour and who works for the shortest, and be a TRUE COWHORSE!

## Requirement
In the virtual environment you run the Python code, you should have the following packages:
```
numpy
pandas
```
You only need two simple packages to be a 100% TRUE COWHORSE!

## How to use the code
Download the "月度汇总表" from [Deli cloud](delicloud.com). Then put all of them into the directory `Details`。Make sure that you have renamed all the `.xlsx` files following the format below:
```
月度汇总表_YYYYMMDD_YYYYMMDD.xlsx
```
On the other hand, make sure you have a name list containing all the people whose working hour is of your concern in the paraent directory of `Details`. An example is shown in this repo as `nameList.xlsx`. 

Then, simply type the following command in the `Details` directory:
```
python AeroCowHorse.py
```
Then you'll get `汇总结果-original.xlsx`, which summarizes everyone's working hour and the number of 'late' incidences. Sample inputs and output are listed in `Details` directory of this repo.
